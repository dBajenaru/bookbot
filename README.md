# bookbot

My first project on GitHub.
This is a CLI tool that reads a `.txt` file and returns the word count and the count of each `alpha` char sorted from most occurances to least.
This is a great tool for analyzing books in particular.

**Usage:** `python3 main.py <path_to_txt_file>`
           `python3 main.py` will print the above line to stdout
